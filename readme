An Efficient Algorithm for Line Clipping in 2-D Computer Graphics.

This interesting attempt origins from an easy but classic task in Computer Graphics: To clip lines with a rectangular window. In the class, I creatively introduced the idea of Hough space into this task, transforming the problem focusing on area and line into a problem focusing on line and point. Finally I successfully refined and implemented this idea.

I also reproduced some well-known SOTA methods, such as Cohen-Sutherland Liang-Barsky's method, comparing with my algorithm. It shows that my algorithm got the best result.

The slide is also attached.

One more thing: I think it's promising to use such ideas in related tasks in 3D vision...
